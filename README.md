# PySong

Created for my final Python project at OWATC.

PySong is a simple GUI program for managing MP3 metadata, and converting common audio formats to MP3.  
It is meant to streamline management of a digital library, and is helpful for sorting your music regardless
of what playback software you use.

FFMPEG is required for file conversion and can be obtained at: http://ffmpeg.org/

The program can be executed using Python if the packages are installed, or it can be built using setup.py
and ran as a standalone executable file.
